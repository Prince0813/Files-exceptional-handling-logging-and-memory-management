        "**1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "- Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line, translating each line to machine code during runtime (e.g., Python). Compiled languages translate the entire code into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++). This typically makes compiled languages faster but less flexible for quick testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue its execution instead of crashing. It is implemented using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "- The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "- Logging in Python is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. It is used to record messages for diagnosis and troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is the significance of the **del** method in Python?**\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for clean-up activities before an object is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n",
        "- import module imports the entire module and access is via module.name. from module import name imports a specific attribute or function directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "- Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks or a single except block with a tuple of exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # code\n",
        "except (TypeError, ValueError):\n",
        "    # handle multiple exceptions\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "- The `with` statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file when the block is exited, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "- Multithreading uses threads to run tasks concurrently within a single process.\n",
        "- Multiprocessing uses separate processes with independent memory spaces.\n",
        "- Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks, whereas multithreading is better for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "- Logging provides a way to track the flow of a program, helps with debugging, keeps records of events, and aids in identifying issues during production.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "- Memory management in Python involves managing the allocation and deallocation of memory automatically using private heap space and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Write code in a try block.\n",
        "2. Handle exceptions using one or more except blocks.\n",
        "3. Optionally use else to execute code if no exception occurs.\n",
        "4. Use finally to execute code regardless of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "- Effective memory management ensures efficient resource use, prevents memory leaks, and improves the performance of applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
        "- The try block contains code that may raise an exception. The except block handles the exception if it occurs, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "- Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free up unused memory. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is automatically deallocated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
        "- The else block runs if the try block does not raise an exception. It is used to place code that should run only when no exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "- The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "- os.fork() is a Unix-specific system call that creates a child process. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform and provides a higher-level interface for parallel processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "- Closing a file releases system resources, ensures data is flushed from the buffer to the file, and prevents file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire file as a single string. file.readline() reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "- The logging module is used for tracking events, errors, and other significant occurrences in a program. It provides flexible logging levels and output options.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "- The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file and directory manipulation like creating, deleting, and navigating directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "- Challenges include managing reference cycles, avoiding memory leaks, and ensuring that large objects are properly deleted to free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "- You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"Invalid value\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "- Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, which can improve the performance of I/O-bound applications by making better use of system resources.\n"
